# Guessing Game #

The guessing game application allows you to play a game similar to hangman with node.js.


The theme is animals. 

One the game is started a random animal will be selected. You will guess a letter, if the guessed letter is a part of the animal word it will display on the screen. 


The application uses classes and contructors to generate the random works and check the guesses against the random word. I used two constructors letter and word, which take in the random word from the main index file including the game logic.

 If you want to try it out on your own, clone the repository and be sure to check the package.json file.
